# Backtrack_Robot
Implementation of the Backtrack algorithm; Exercise in Refactoring

### The scenario

A robot is in the top-left corner of a grid, and wants to travel to a given destination (r, c).
She can only move DOWN and to the RIGHT. Determine her path from (0,0) to (r,c).

### The hitch

There're obstacles!

To implement this, I let the user enter how many obstacles, and randomly disperse that many throughout the game board (the grid).

### Using the program

1. Enter the destination coordinates of the robot (r, c).
2. Enter how many obstacles you'd like to throw in.
3. See if there is a path available.
