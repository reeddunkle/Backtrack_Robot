# Backtrack_Robot
Implementation of the Backtrack algorithm; Exercise in Refactoring

### The scenario

A robot is in the top-left corner of a grid, and wants to travel to a given destination (r, c).
She can only move DOWN and to the RIGHT. Determine her path from (0,0) to (r,c).

### The hitch

There're obstacles!

To implement this, I let the user enter how many obstacles, and randomly disperse that many throughout the game board (the grid).

## Using the program

#### Run the interpreter

```bash
python3 backtrack.py
```

#### Give the robot its destination coordinates, and decide how many obstacles you want to place

#### Press enter to see the board, and wait for the robot to find a path

#### Check out your robot's path
