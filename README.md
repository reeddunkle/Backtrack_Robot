# Backtrack_Robot
Implementation of the Backtrack algorithm; Exercise in Refactoring

### The scenario

A robot is in the top-left corner of a grid, and wants to travel to a given destination (r, c).
She can only move DOWN and to the RIGHT. Determine her path from (0,0) to (r,c).

### The hitch

There are obstacles!

To implement this, I let the user enter how many obstacles, and randomly disperse them throughout the game board.

# Using the program

### Installation

Clone the git repo

```
git clone https://github.com/reeddunkle/Backtrack_Robot.git
```

### Testing

Navigate to the repo

```
cd Backtrack_Robot
```

Run the Python3 interpreter

```
python3 backtrack_OOP.py
```

#### Give the robot its destination coordinates, and decide how many obstacles you want to place
