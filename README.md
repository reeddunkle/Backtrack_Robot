# Backtrack Robot
A backtracking algorithm employing memoization*

1. Give the robot its destination coordinates, and decide how many obstacles you want to place

2. Press enter to see the board, and wait for the robot to find a path

3. Check out your robot's path!


*The chevrons ^ denote the memoized squares


### The scenario

A robot is in the top-left corner of a grid, and wants to travel to a given destination (r, c).
She can only move DOWN and to the RIGHT. Determine her path from (0,0) to (r,c).

### The hitch

There are obstacles!

To implement this, the user enters a number of obstacles to be randomly dispersed throughout the game board.
